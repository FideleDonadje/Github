L3: File Copy

I designed a copy_file function that copy a file. It takes 2 arguments
the name of the file to copy and the name of the file to create 
This function has been tested and works but the copy of the file 
from one directory to the other doesn't work properly. I iterate
through all the files in the folder and I copy each of them. I didn't 
submit the makefile since the the main program is not working well
